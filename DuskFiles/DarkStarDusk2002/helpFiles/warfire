Warfire's Help

News:

There is a new feature on the horizon.

It is a typing system as usually seen in such wonders as Fantasy MUDs.

It will provide "typed" mobs and weapons.  These weapons will give bonuses when used against certain Mobs.

More details when the code is done.

Commands:

The new makegod command works such :

makegod PlayerName Privs

where Privs is an integer where:

0 = normal player
2 = Apprentice Diety
3 = Diety
4 = Elite Diety

The new morph command works such:

morph PlayerName Race

where Race is one of the standard races:

darkelf
elf
human
demon
ice demon
lizard
orc
Wizard

These are both Master God commands.

The new script command log works such:

log trigger "What was done"

This then prints "Trigger was logged as: What was done" directly to the log.  But it in move actions where you believe people are abusing a tile.

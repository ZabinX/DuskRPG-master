	Inscribed within this ancient book of records is kept the secrets of the Demonic blade the CHAOS SWORD and the coming of Cyril.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Billions of years ago out of the nothingness came the gods. They built the universe. The galaxies within it. Theyre more treasured planet was DarkStar. 

Unfortunately for them the Burning Hells which they created for evil men was linked to this world. Demons infested these hells. They traveled through Ethereal Gates 

to the mortal world to cause havok. The gods fought these demons relentlessly. Soon after the attacks just ended. It was unknown why. One demon....ruled hell. 

His name was Itenpun. He hated these gods. He took a great sacrafice. He gave up his powers to create the ultimate Unholy sword and armor. The Chaos armor 

was unbreakable. The gods mighty weapons were unable to destroy it. Theyre worst enemy was not Itenpun himself. It was his sword. The chaos sword contained 

all Itenpuns power. Fortunately for the gods he could not contain the power of the sword for long. The power backlashed at him. He lost his memory and most of his

powers. The gods used this opportunity to gain an ally. They chose a better name. They called him ......Cyril. His sword had lost some power from the backlash attack

on Cyril. Thus forth Cyril wields this sword and his special armor. Yet the demon still lurks inside. Cyril is willing to give his sword and armor to the first mortal to beat him 

in combat. Let us hope that if this happens......the winner will be able to control the powers.......

Welcome to Duskmoon!	 A new world created using the old open source GMUD 'Dusk' client/engine created ~2000.
			 First release:
			 Episode 1:  Showcases old Dusk's features using scripts and magic groups recycled from old Dusk worlds.  
			 New features have been created by me in the form of Dusk script hacking.  There's a lot of neat script's out there in Duskmoon!
			 So go on and eat some flan's when your hungry, solve puzzles, help the local townspeople, find treasures, side quests, and then save the world!

DuskZ alpha
-----------

This is a test version of DuskZ - a 'new' version of Dusk.

A game exists in game/
Client files are in client/
Binaries are in share/java
Launch scripts are in bin/

Prerequisites
-------------

A javafx capable version of java must be installed and in the path.
Currently this must be obtained from Oracle and the openjdk supplied
with most GNU/Linux distrubtions will not suffice.

Start server
------------

Run the duskz-server script.

bin/duskz-server path-to-game

To launch the demo game assuming you are in the root of the
distribution.

$ bin/duskz-server game

Start client
------------

Run the duskz-client script.

bin/duskz-client [ path-to-resources ]

By default it will use the resources in client/

So to launch the client for the demo game:

bin/duskz-client

Use the bookmarked server (127.0.0.1:7480), and login with username
and password of 'z'.

Creating a new user should also work - just enter in a new username
with no password.

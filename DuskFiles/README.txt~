	This README will explain what these files do.  I have 2 Dusk worlds in here that were made back in early 2000's plus my demo world using 	 the latest upgrades by Wildern.  Sorry for writing so much here but this should give you the jist of what each Dusk world/engine is about.

	The "img" folder contains tilesets that came from "Valyria Tear" and "Hero of Allacrost".  I'm trying to expand it to help out those 		games while hoping that maybe Dusk will get developed further and be able to use those assets.  

*	DarkStarDusk2002:  Dusk world from 2000-2002 (not sure about the date, I may have been in 7th grade) that I (Zabin) remember contributing 	  to.  I've played a bit and seen some stuff I made back in the day which was pretty neat to see.)

*	NewDusk2002:  Quote from Wildern, "I made the backup on 9/23/2002 just a few days before the machine hosting new dusk disappeared."  I 		remember Tom having OldDusk and NewDusk but because I was a god on OldDusk I don't remember much of this Dusk.  I'll try and obtain a 		version of OldDusk.

******	Dusk2.7.3:  Last offical update ~2003.  This is my Dusk demo world I've been building and haven't named yet.  These have Wildern's 		latest .class files.  The binary Java files (where the magic happens) contains a client(WWW folder) and all the server data files needed 	 to run/host Dusk.  Any developer looking for a hobby game to fork/upgrade should build upon this as it's the most bug free version.

**	Dusk2.7.3src:  The source files (where Java programmers work their magic) included is "wildern's" Dusk Map Editor source.

*	DuskMapEditor, makes it alot easier then walking around in game mapping.  Made to edit Dusk's "shortmap" file.

***	DuskZ server 2013:  Notzed's upgraded fork.  It's in a bit of a broken/incomplete/dead-ended state and he may have another new           		incompatable/incomplete version as he was looking into changing the database.  Lots of cool new features were implemented but most of 		Dusk's features are incompatable with this new fork because he changed the Duskscript over to Javascript.  He quit in the middle of 		working on it for other interests and work got in the way but who knows he may poke at it again someday.  I thought I'd make this 		available because all the features I wish for Dusk he coded in here.  If I knew how to program I would take his work here and implement 	the upgrades into 2.7.3 and hopefully not break anything while keeping the old Duskscript and Bam!  You'd have a new game :P

*	Dusk3.0.1:  I just found these files at "http://www.ohloh.net/p/duskrpg" it looks like one of the old developers "Lou" was working on 		this last year(2011)  I actually got in touch with him about a month and a half ago, ATM it's 11-18-2012.  He seems to still be 	 	 interested in reviving Dusk so he bought/updated the old site dusk.wesowin.org and had forums up October to communicate about Dusk.  It 	got overrun by spam-bots and went down the beginning of this month.  It's been a few weeks since I last herd from him but I know he is a 	 extreamly busy guy.  I just hope he uploads his latest source files because he made some really good improvements.  He said he made Dusk 	 compatable with Tiled which means he's getting more map layers implemented in game.  Making the GUI more modern looking and working on 		more fluid walking animation.  I remember him saying he was looking into fast-tracking his new Dusk simply to have it running and he 		should have java web-start up in a few days.  Looking at 3.0.1 you can obviously see he's rearranged everything and added a bunch of new 	 stuff but I don't see the client in there so those files are kinda incomplete.  If/when Lou makes his newest source files available I'll 	 be sure to upload them here.  If you want to try and contact him his email is "louis.agoglia@gmail.com".

Running the game locally:

To get Dusk's server running- all that is needed is Sun Java 6 installed, apache to point the server to localhost(127.0.0.1), and then you just put the client files into apache (/var/www) with this command "sudo cp -r client.html duskclient.jar rc /var/www/dusk"  Then you startup Dusk with this command run in Terminal in the main directory "java -cp . DuskServer".  These instructions run Dusk locally as an applet and I still plan to explain this better.

Update:  Notzed showed me how to run Dusk as an application.  Here's the instructions copied from my blog.

	Start the Dusk Server with these commands run in terminal:

	Zabin@Zabin-laptop:~$ cd /home/Zabin/DuskRPG/DuskFiles/Dusk2.7.3
	Zabin@Zabin-laptop:~/DuskRPG/DuskFiles/Dusk2.7.3$ java -cp . DuskServer
	Loading...
	Ready for connections.

	Then run the client:

	Zabin@Zabin-laptop:~/DuskRPG/DuskFiles/Dusk2.7.3$ cd /home/Zabin/DuskRPG/DuskFiles/Dusk2.7.3/www
	Zabin@Zabin-laptop:~/DuskRPG/DuskFiles/Dusk2.7.3/www$ java -cp duskclient.jar Dusk

	The GUI should come up and prompt you to click connect.  Make sure the port is "7474" and the address is 127.0.0.1

	I'm on Ubuntu linux 10.04, obviously you'll have to change "Zabin" to whatever your system is called.

Here's what needs to be fixed on Dusk. 
1.  More map layers and using the Tiled map editor.  (NotZed's already implemented this in his fork of the server 'DuskZ')
2.  GUI needs to look better.  (NotZed's JavaFX GUI's for the main screen, equipment screen, and merchant screen are awesome in DuskZ!!)
3.  Walking animation isn't working right.  (NotZed fixed this so it's at least 2 frames alternating every direction and also fixed the flicker.  I'm very happy how it looks in his DuskZ)
4.  Players should be 64x32 pixels on screen (right now they are 64x64 and resized down to 32x32 to fit on 1 tile!).  (NotZed fixed this also in his fork :D )
5.  Sprites (mobs) same as players need to be positioned on game different so there could be various monster sizes.
